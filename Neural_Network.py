Neural Network



--> there are differnrt kinds of neural networks.
   where there is called the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
   ...  there are the inputs called the dendrites..
and there aur transport of outpts and storing of data called the AXON.


---->  input meanas no. of attributes/data... 
       when we make a perfect ANN where we have one output and one input layer.
        input and hidden layers are called the layers which is decided by us.
       neural is the gpu of any systems...
        the first hidden layer process the data firstly...
       there is activation function where we have to process the data by the hidden layer...
       



.....>  the first layer is the input layer where we give the inputs..
        the second layer is the hidden layer and its all about our choice where we can decide how much we can contribute
            every neuron of input layer is connected with each neuron of the hidden layer...
        if we use the hidden layer that much we also need the tpu,gpu and cpu for the better processing...
        the mathematical equation use in this for processing that function is known as Activation Function...


......> (Activation Function) ...if there is more than two hidden layers so it is called the deep Neural Networks...
                   and output is the processung part between the hidden layers... and it is called the output...
                   there is cost function where is used for find out the errors...
                     
                 use cases...
                 ..> performance search
                 ...>  voice procesing
                 ...>  self driver car
                   ...>  computer games
 .......>    no.of attribute is described into the input layer...it means each and every attribute should describe the neuron..

                          
        
               y=m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+b
                   where 'm' is the  weight.
    ......> there is a processs which called the Back Propogation... in which it changes into the weights in the input layer.
